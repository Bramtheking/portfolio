- OAuth 2.0 authentication with short-lived tokens
- Request signing with certificates
- Callback URL verification
- Real-time transaction status updates
- Handling network timeouts and failed transactions
- Currency conversion and reconciliation
- Testing in sandbox before production deployment

HOW I OVERCAME THE CHALLENGES:

1. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY:
   - Implemented secure credential storage using environment variables
   - Created token refresh mechanism to handle expiring OAuth tokens
   - Set up SSL certificate validation for API requests
   - Implemented request signing with proper encryption

2. CALLBACK HANDLING:

   - Implemented automated testing for critical payment flows
   - Conducted load testing to ensure system could handle concurrent transactions

RESULT:
Successfully processed thousands of transactions with 99.8% success rate. The system handles payment notifications in real-time, automatically updates order statuses, and provides detailed transaction history for businesses.
